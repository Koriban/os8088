;
; CLEAR SKIES' LOADER - the IMAGE of SKIES.O88, and the whole of what the
; kernel launches (SPEC.md 88.10.4, 20.12.10).
;
; It reads the two parts, tells the program where the art went, and asks the
; kernel to treat the program as the program. Then its region is freed and it
; is gone: what runs is apps/skies/skies.asm, at PART 0, in the parts carve,
; with an instance and a window and a name of its own and no idea any of this
; happened.
;
; WHY IT EXISTS IS A NUMBER. `image + bss` is bounded by APP_MAX_SIZE - 61,440
; bytes, and it bounds ONE segment because a package addresses itself with
; 16-bit offsets. Clear Skies was at 61,100 of it, with the DIAGNOSTIC and
; PROBE builds 436 and 585 bytes OVER, so `make skiesdiag` did not assemble
; and two registered rows were skipping. §88.10.3 took the title art out of
; the image and bought 3,268; this takes the READER out too, and buys the
; disk back (88.10.3.1) - a parted image cannot be compressed, so with the
; body inside it SKIES.O88 went 37,534 -> 49,031 bytes on a 360KB apps disk
; with 8 clusters spare. As a PART the body is OP_COMP like everything else.
;
; IT MUST NOT CREATE A WINDOW (SPEC.md 20.12.10.6): its region is about to be
; freed, so a window whose W_SEG named it would far-call a dead claim on its
; first repaint. The program's window is the one the user sees.
