"""Clear Skies' worlds, each assembled on its own and packed (SPEC.md 88.10.5).

    python3 tools/csworlds.py --out build

A world is data the renderer walks with DS - `cs_scene` reads `[si +
CSO_MODEL]` and then `[di + CSM_TYPE]`, at 169 ms a frame - so it cannot be
addressed through a segment. It is copied into an OVERLAY in the program's bss
instead, at a fixed org, and every near pointer inside it is already right.

This builds each world through `apps/skies/cswone.asm`, which lays the shared
vocabulary at CS_WLD_ORG and the world at CS_WLD_ORG + CS_VOCAB_MAX - the same
two addresses the overlay uses - then KEEPS ONLY WHAT FOLLOWS the vocabulary
and packs it. The vocabulary is packed once, on its own.

What it also writes is `cswidx.inc`, the RESIDENT index: nine locations, each
with the world it stands in, the offset of its location record inside that
world, and its name. The names have to be resident because the launcher lists
all nine before any world is loaded; they are COPIED OUT of the world blobs
here rather than typed a second time, so there is nothing to keep in step.

CS_DEFPORT is DERIVED, and that is a fix rather than a tidy-up: skies.asm
carried it as a hand-kept 5 under a comment warning that moving Paris down the
list would silently change which runway a fresh instance opens on. It is the
index of PARIS-ISSY, worked out here.

    and lays the vocabulary and then the world exactly where cs_wldget will
    put them, so a map of it IS the guest's addresses - nothing to bias.

    `[map all]` and NOT assemble()'s listing parse, which is what the streams
    are cut with. A mesh is declared by a MACRO - `CS_PYR cs_m_lcy_shd, 28,
    306, 28` - and a listing renders the macro's body with `%1:` in it, so
    the label's own name never appears in the file at all and every mesh in
    every world is invisible to a reader of one. nasm's map has them because
    it is the assembler's own symbol table. It also has the pure constants,
    which is why it is not what cswidx.inc's vocabulary equs are cut from:
    there a stray CSM_STACK would become an absolute address.
