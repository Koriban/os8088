"""The macro recorder (SPEC.md 81.74).

    make && python3 tests/sheetrecord.py

81.68 is titled "Macro arguments in R1C1, the way the recorder writes them",
and this is that recorder. What makes it worth gating is that it emits the
SAME language 81.63 runs: a recording is an ordinary macro sheet afterwards.
So this test does not just read the cells it wrote - it RUNS them, on a fresh
part of the sheet, and checks the actions happened again.

  1. Set Recorder on E1, Record, then: select A1, type 11, select A2, type
     22. Stop.
  2. The recorded cells are read out of SHEET's own SYLK save and must be the
     macro text, in ABSOLUTE references - Excel's initial state and this
     recorder's default. Each entry is followed by the step down Enter caused,
     and the redundant click on A2 records nothing at all
  3. ...and running it from Macro > Run puts 11 and 22 back after A1:A2 has
     been cleared, which is the part that proves the recording is a MACRO and
     not a transcript

and Macro > Start Recorder (81.107), Excel's pause-and-continue:

  4. it is GREYED before Set Recorder, and live after the first Stop
  5. choosing it CONTINUES the same macro: typing 33 into A3 lands on the
     row Stop's RETURN() was on - "if the end of the recorder range contains
     a RETURN function, RETURN is overwritten" - and the second Stop writes
     the one RETURN at the new end. The replay then puts 33 back as well
