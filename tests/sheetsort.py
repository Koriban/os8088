"""Sort orders every kind of constant, and an error constant stays one
(SPEC.md 81.61).

    make && python3 tests/sheetsort.py

Data > Sort ordered NUMBERS only: a label, a logical and an error value in the
key column sat the sort out, their rows never moving - so sorting a column of
names did nothing at all. Excel's ascending order is numbers, then text in any
case, then logicals, then errors. And an error CONSTANT - #DIV/0! held as a
value, not computed - was lost three ways: Fill Right stored 0, Copy/Paste
carried the zero underneath it, and a typed #N/A became a label.

The HOST writes a SYLK file; everything is driven through the real menus and
read back from SHEET's own SYLK save:

  1. Fill Right from C1, which holds #DIV/0!, into D1: D1 is #DIV/0!.
  2. Copy C1, Paste into E1: E1 is #DIV/0!.
  3. #n/a typed into F1: F1 is the error #N/A, not a label.
  4. Sort on A1 alone - the whole column - ascending: 3, "pear", TRUE, #N/A,
     1, "Banana", FALSE, "apple", 2, ="cherry" and =1.5 come out 1, =1.5, 2,
     3, apple, Banana, ="cherry", pear, FALSE, TRUE, #N/A - the two formulas
     by their results, and the labels in any case (ASCII puts B before a).
  5. Sort G1:H4 on G, ascending, then descending: the key's classes order,
     and H comes with them row for row.
