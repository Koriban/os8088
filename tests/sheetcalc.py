"""Calculation: Manual, and Options > Calculate Now (SPEC.md 81.78).

    make && python3 tests/sheetcalc.py

`sh_drawgrid` re-evaluates every formula cell on EVERY repaint, so
Calculation: Manual is not a label on a no-op - it is what a big sheet on a
4.77 MHz 8088 actually needs, and Calculate Now is then the only way to catch
up. Until 81.78 that command existed only as the third choice inside the
Calculation dialog; Excel has it on the Options menu as well, directly after
Calculation..., and now so does SHEET.

The whole point is a formula that is DELIBERATELY STALE, which is the one
thing an ordinary sheet never shows - so every check here is about a value
being wrong on purpose and then right again:

  1. B1 is =A1+1 with A1 = 1, so it reads 2
  2. Calculation: Manual, then 5 typed into A1 - B1 still reads 2, because
     nothing recalculates. A gate that only checked the END state would pass
     on a build where Manual did nothing at all
  3. Options > Calculate Now - B1 reads 6

It is read off the GLASS, by the kernel's own glyphs, because "what the cell
shows" is exactly the question: the record's cached value is what Manual
leaves stale, and reading the record would be reading the thing under test.
