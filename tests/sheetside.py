"""Insert and Delete move a cell's BORDERS with it (SPEC.md 81.58).

    make && python3 tests/sheetside.py

Insert and Delete Row/Column moved the cells, their formulas' references
(the reidx pass) and, since 81.56, the column widths - but not the border
table or the note table, which are keyed by position like the cells and were
never walked. A bordered cell moved down a row and its border stayed where it
had been drawn, on a cell that was now something else.

The border is what can be SEEN: with gridlines off, a border is the only ink
on a cell's edge. The host writes a BIFF3 file with A1 bordered top and
bottom; SHEET opens it, the grid is measured with its lines on, and then
Options > Gridlines: Off leaves the borders alone on the glass.

  1. A1's top and bottom edges are inked, A2's bottom is not
  2. Insert Row at A1: the border is on A2 now - A1's top edge is bare
  3. Delete Row at A1: back where it began
  4. Save As Normal: A1's cell names an XF with the top and bottom borders
  5. Delete Row at A1 again, the bordered cell's own row: its border goes
     with it, rather than landing on the row that moves up into its place

The note table goes through the same routine (sh_rc_table) with its own
record size; nothing SHEET writes carries a note, so it is the borders that
are observed.
