"""DIALOG.BOX: a custom dialog described by a range (macro plan wave 4,
SPEC.md 81.96).

    make && python3 tests/sheetmdbox.py

B1:H10 describes one dialog - OK, Cancel, a label, a text box, a check box,
an option group of two, and a number box - and MAIN puts it up four times.
The first is typed at and clicked through, then Enter: every result lands in
the seventh column and the cell answers 1, the default OK's item number. The
second is dismissed with Esc, the third with its Cancel button, and neither
touches a result. The fourth, OK clicked with the mouse, answers 1 again, and the fifth is
dismissed with its CLOSE BOX, which must also answer FALSE and must not cost
a window slot - the kernel only HIDES a package's secondary window, so the
dialog has to refuse that close and destroy itself instead (81.96.2).
Before any of them, three ranges are refused under ERROR(FALSE), each as
FALSE: one with a list box (type 15), one only three columns wide - which
would read its sizes from cells outside itself and write every result over
them - and one of a single row, which would be a dialog with no items and no
button to end it. Everything is read back from SHEET's own save.
