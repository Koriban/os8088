"""Data > Form - one record at a time, in a dialog (SPEC.md 81.71.5).

    make && python3 tests/sheetform.py

Form is the one database command that touches no criteria at all: it reads
the DATABASE name and nothing else, and it is a whole dialog engine of its
own - the sixth. It is also the first dialog in this app to live in
CHART.OVL (81.71.5.1), reached through resident thunks, so this row gates
THAT arrangement as much as the feature: a callback that ran before the
module was in would paint an empty window.

The database (A1:C4) is three records over three fields:

    Name    Type   Amount
    Apple   Fruit  10
    Beet    Veg    20
    Cherry  Fruit  30

  1. Form opens on `1 of 3` with the field NAMES read out of the header row
     and Apple's own values beside them
  2. Next walks to `2 of 3` and Beet's values - the counter and the fields
     move together
  3. Typing over the focused field and pressing Enter writes the change back
     to the CELL, which the saved file then carries: A3 is Plum, not Beet
  4. New appends a record and grows DATABASE to cover it, so the counter
     reads `4 of 4`
  5. Close leaves the user's own selection where it was and not on whichever
     field was last edited - sh_df_savefld banks it across sh_commit, and
     without that the cursor ends up in the middle of the database

THE DIALOG IS FOUND, NOT DERIVED. It is a top-level window centred on the
live screen, and the arithmetic for that ("(screen - W) / 2, clamped under
the menu bar") does NOT agree with where it actually lands - it was six
pixels out vertically and five horizontally the first time this was written
that way, which reads as "every field is empty" rather than as a coordinate
being wrong. So the counter is SEARCHED for by its own `n of m` shape and
everything else is measured from it, which is also the standing rule about
never trusting a remembered pull-down offset, one dialog along.
