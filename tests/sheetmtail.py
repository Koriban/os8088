"""The pulldown leaves nothing behind it (SPEC.md 81.98).

    make && python3 tests/sheetmtail.py

SHEET's Data menu has twelve items, and on a 200-row screen its panel hangs
PAST the window's bottom edge, over the dock. Closing it used to repaint the
window and nothing else, so the rows below the window kept the menu's last
items painted on them for the rest of the session (docs/plans/
SHEET-GAPS-PLAN.md section 0.1).

The fix banks what the panel covers and writes it back. This gate:

  1. photographs the screen, holds Data open and reads the panel's rect out
     of SHEET's own memory - which PROVES the panel overhangs the window
     (a panel inside it would make the rest of this pass vacuously), and that
     the bank was taken;
  2. releases it off the panel, so nothing runs, and compares every row below
     the window with the photograph: they must be identical;
  3. drags the window DOWN, so the same menu runs off the bottom of the
     SCREEN. The panel is NOT slid up (81.98: a slid bar menu covers its own
     title and lands under the pointer, where a plain click would fire an
     item), so the bank must clip at the screen's last row - and closing it
     must still leave nothing.

`--card vga` runs the FOUR-PLANE path, which the CGA arms never reach: the
bank's size is planes x rows x byte columns and CGA has one plane. On the
VGA machine (640x480) it asserts, through the card's own rendered
framebuffer, that opening and closing Data leaves ZERO differing pixels -
and then, as tests/atmenusu.py does, pokes the bank flag to 0 while the
panel is up so the close takes the REPAINT fallback, and checks that too.
