"""README.TXT packs to exactly 8,088 bytes, because the machine is an 8088.

    python3 tests/unit/t_readme8088.py

A JOKE, PINNED.  `readme.txt` is the system disk's manual (SPEC.md 19.6) and
it ships LZ4-wrapped (SPEC.md 20.13.4); the packed file is 8,088 bytes and the
whole reason for that number is the part number on the front of the box.
Nothing in the OS reads it, no layout depends on it, and a byte either way
costs the machine nothing - which is exactly why it needs a row.  A size that
means something is defended by whatever it means; this one is defended by
nobody, so the next ordinary edit to the prose would retire it silently and
the person after that would never know it had been there.

**SO WHEN THIS GOES RED, NOTHING IS BROKEN.**  Somebody edited the manual and
the joke came loose.  The fix is the PROSE and never the number in this file:
add or cut until the packed file is 8,088 again.  The row prints the delta and
roughly what it is worth in characters, and the two ends the manual is already
bounded at do not move - `tools/checkreadme.py` still holds the 28-column
formatted width and Note Pad's 16KB ceiling, so there is room in both
directions.

WHY IT IS `soak`.  It is about one file, it can only be broken by editing that
file, and the person who edits it is the person the row is for
(docs/WRITING-TESTS.md 2.1).  Charging every `make` for a joke would be the
wrong tier twice over.

WHAT IT COMPUTES RATHER THAN READS.  The Makefile applies CRLF at build time
and wraps the result (`$(SYSDOCRAW)` and `$(SYSDOC)`), so this does those two
steps to `readme.txt` itself.  The row then needs no `build/` at all and
cannot be fooled by a knob build: a tree built with `make PKGZ=` has a PLAIN
`build/readme.txt`, and a row that read it would go red for a knob rather than
for an edit.  The shipped artefact is checked too, but only when it IS a `CZ`
file - which is the same assertion from the other end, and catches the
Makefile wrapping the manual in some way this file does not predict.

THE OTHER PLACES THE SIZE IS WRITTEN DOWN, since a re-take has to reach them:
the `$(SYSDOC)` comment in the Makefile and SPEC.md 20.13.4's `README.TXT`
paragraph both quote it, and nothing checks either.
