"""Data > Find, Extract and Delete (SPEC.md 81.71).

    make && python3 tests/sheetdbcmd.py

81.65 built the criteria engine and 81.69 the two names it reads its
rectangles from; these three commands are that engine driven from the MENU,
and what has to be proved is that the menu reaches it - that the DATABASE and
CRITERIA names resolve into the same sh_db_*/sh_cr_* a formula's arguments
fill, and that each command then does its own distinct thing to the rows that
match.

The database (A1:C4) is three records over three fields, with Type the
criterion and Amount the payload - three because the CGA window shows four
rows at once and every cell this test CLICKS has to be on the glass:

    Name    Type   Amount
    Apple   Fruit  10
    Beet    Veg    20
    Cherry  Fruit  30

E1:E2 is the criteria range - the header `Type` over the condition `Fruit` -
so the two Fruit records match and they are NOT adjacent: a Delete that
shifted the wrong way, or an Extract that stopped at the first gap, cannot
pass by luck.

  1. FIND selects the first matching record (Apple, row 2) and selects it
     WHOLE - a range, which the grid draws with a second inset frame, so the
     right edge of the selection is column C's and not column A's
  2. the item now reads `Exit Find`; choosing it puts the label back to
     `Find` with the record still selected, and the NEXT Find steps to Cherry
     in row 4 - the "first record BELOW the active cell" rule, which is the
     Reference Guide's own find-and-replace loop
  3. EXTRACT copies both matching records into G1:H3, whose header row names
     two of the three fields in the OTHER order (Amount, Name) - a subset,
     reordered, which is Excel's own rule
  4. DELETE removes both Fruit records; Beet shifts UP inside the database to
     fill the gap, and - the part that separates this from Edit > Delete -
     the cell parked at C6, below the database, does NOT move

Everything is read back out of SHEET's own SYLK save, except the Find
selection and the relabelled menu item, which only exist on the glass.
