"""A macro cell's FORMULA survives a Normal save (SPEC.md 81.83).

    make && python3 tests/sheetmbiff.py

Until 81.83 every one of 81.63's twenty macro functions was 0xFF in
`sh_rpn_fid`, so a Normal save wrote the cell's cached VALUE and the macro
was gone. SYLK carried it; BIFF did not. 81.68 recorded the blocker: Excel
numbers macro COMMANDS through the Command Equivalents Table and macro
FUNCTIONS through the ordinary one, and no reference on hand had the former.
docs/ms-xls.pdf does.

This gate is byte-level on purpose, because "the formula came back" is a
weaker claim than the one that matters:

  1. **The tokens are the ones Excel 2.1d writes.** SELECT and RETURN are
     checked against the bytes in a macro sheet real Excel wrote, which ships
     in this tree as build/sheetxl2/excel21d/KWWHAT.CPM. Not "a formula
     round-trips through our own reader" - our reader and writer can agree
     with each other and both be wrong, which is the whole reason 81.68
     refused to guess.
  2. **Both tables, and both ptgs.** SELECT/BEEP are Cetab and go out as ptg
     0x58; RETURN/HALT are Ftab and go out as 0x42. The split is not
     guessable from the names - GOTO and RETURN look exactly like commands
     and are functions - so a build that put all twenty in one table passes
     no check here.
  3. **A dotted name survives the lexer.** CALCULATE.NOW is one of three
     whose '.' used to end the identifier, so they could not be written even
     once the numbers were known.
