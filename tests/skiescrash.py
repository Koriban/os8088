"""THE WINDSHIELD IS DRAWN WHOLE (SPEC.md 88.7.11.1).

    python3 tests/skiescrash.py [--machine os8088_5150_herc_gla]

A crash freezes the picture and draws eight cracks over it for CS_CRASHT
ticks. Reported from the air, on Hercules: the UPPER part of the view is wrong
after a crash.

It is 88.13.3.1's rule, applied one caller short. cs_seg reads three words to
decide what a segment owes the glass, and cs_crackle runs AFTER cs_scene, so
all three hold the LAST OBJECT DRAWN's values: cs_pinview would skip the clip,
cs_pwhole would skip the marking outright, and cs_markacc would accumulate
into an object box cs_drawobj flushed a moment ago and resets for its first
object next frame. Either way the marks are lost, and an unmarked run never
reaches the glass (88.3.1). The horizon and the panel (cs_pclip) both take all
three stores; cs_crackle took only cs_pinview.

WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE is a windshield with a hole in it: a crack appears
wherever SOMETHING ELSE marked the row - the ground, a building, the horizon
segment - and nowhere else. Over open sky, which on Hercules is the top of the
view and is black, nothing marks a row and the cracks up there were never
drawn at all. The star and the ring stop dead at the horizon.

The row pins 300 m over Paris with the nose down, so the view has real sky
above a real city below, crashes the aeroplane where it stands, and counts
what the crash ADDS to each half:

  1. the crash reaches the glass at all - so a row that poked a state byte
     and photographed two identical frames would not pass;
  2. and it reaches THE SKY, above the horizon the guest itself reports in
     cs_hzy0 - 129 lit pixels against 0;
  3. and EVERY ROW IT WROTE IS RECORDED: the shadow and the frame's span set
     are read on either side of cs_crackle, and a row whose bytes changed
     must have a span that covers them. The shipped routine changes 111 rows
     and leaves 75 of them outside their own span, most with no span at all;
--clobber-crash is the red run (docs/WRITING-TESTS.md 1): it NOPs the two
stores the fix added and the one that puts the borrow back, which is
cs_crackle exactly as it shipped, and CHECKS 2 AND 3 must go red.

AND IT IS ALSO WHY A CRACK OUTLIVES THE CRASH, which is how it was reported:
cs_blit copies each row over cur UNION prv, and the next frame's sky/ground
pass refills only prv. A crack run that was never marked itself but fell
inside the PREVIOUS frame's span reaches the glass once - and once the view
moves on, no span covers it again, so nothing ever erases it. That needs a
MOVING view to happen, which is why it appears on every real crash and on
none of the pinned poses this row can hold still. Check 3 asks the question
without needing the leftover to survive: it snapshots the shadow and the
frame's span set on either side of cs_crackle and holds the routine to
88.3.1's own rule.
