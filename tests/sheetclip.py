"""SHEET's repaint stays inside SHEET (SPEC.md 81.105, upstream issue #152).

    make && python3 tests/sheetclip.py

sh_repaint had NO clip region armed, and almost none of its fifty callers is
a W_PAINT, so its fill and every glyph landed on whatever window was stacked
above SHEET. Data > Chart Column... is the case that shows it, and it IS the
test: the Chart window is created at (0,0), over SHEET's top-left corner,
shown, painted - and then sh_docmd_chart repaints SHEET, in that order.

On the VGA machine, off the card's rendered frame:

  1. photograph SHEET where the Chart is about to land: its ink (header
     letters, gridlines, the numbers) is the signature SHEET would leave
  2. Data > Chart Column... over A1:A3: the Chart opens ON TOP of SHEET and
     overlaps it (the arm is not vacuous)
  3. in that overlap, SHEET's ink is GONE: where SHEET had a black pixel, the
     Chart's content is not simply that black pixel again
  4. and the Chart's FRAME is whole where it lies over SHEET - which is where
     the fork shows the defect. sh_repaint's own tail repaints a dirty,
     uncovered Chart's CONTENT after SHEET draws, so the content survived;
     the frame is the kernel's and nothing redraws it, and SHEET's white
     fill took its right and bottom edges

Not "repaint SHEET again while the Chart is up": any click on SHEET first
RAISES it over the Chart, which is the window manager doing its job, and the
Chart is in front so keys go to it.
