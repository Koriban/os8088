"""Data > Parse splits one column at FIXED CHARACTER POSITIONS (SPEC.md 81.82).

    make && python3 tests/sheetparse.py

Parse is not CSV. CSV splits on a delimiter; Parse splits at character
columns, because the data it exists for is a report another program PRINTED,
where the fields line up because they were laid out for a printer. The
fixture is exactly that - three records, name in columns 0-11, quantity
right-aligned in 12-15, price in 18-22, each row padded differently:

    New York    1234  45.60
    Jones        987  12.05
    Brown         42   7.50

Four things are checked, and two of them separate this from a delimiter
split that would otherwise look identical:

  1. **'New York' survives as ONE field.** Guess's rule is TWO spaces: a
     single space is inside a field, a run ends it. Splitting on every space
     would put 'New' and 'York' in different columns and shift every field
     after them - the single most likely wrong implementation, and the one
     this fixture is shaped to catch.
  2. **The boundaries come from the FIRST cell and are applied to all**, so
     rows 2 and 3 - which pad differently and would tokenise differently -
     must still yield 987/42 in the same column. A build that re-guessed per
     row would pass check 1 and fail this.
  3. **The fields are TYPED by their spelling**, as a CSV field is (81.40):
     1234 and 45.60 come back as NUMBERS, the names as labels.
  4. **No brackets is a refusal, not a no-op that eats the column.** Clear
     then OK must leave the sheet exactly as it was, with a marker cell
     proving the save that shows it landed.
