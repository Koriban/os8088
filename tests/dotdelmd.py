"""DOT DELIRIUM on a TWO-CARD desktop (SPEC.md 93.4): straddle, move between
displays, and go fullscreen from each.

`xt-multimon`'s question, asked of a game. Four things, and three of them can
only go wrong here:

  A  STRADDLING, BOTH DISPLAYS CARRY CONTENT.  The window sits across the
     seam and each card has a real share of the picture on it. A package that
     got this wrong would draw its whole face onto the primary and leave the
     monitor it is actually on showing the desktop.
  B  MOVING BETWEEN DISPLAYS RE-CUTS THE BOARD.  The window manager gives a
     window moved onto the Hercules a taller box, and SPEC.md 93.3 says the
     tile comes out of the live content box and that adapter's PIXEL SHAPE -
     so the tile has to CHANGE, and change back.
  C  THE BRACKET FOLLOWS THE WINDOW.  A same-mode fullscreen owns ONE display
     and must ask which (SPEC.md 53.7.1); both consumers in this tree got that
     wrong first, drawing the whole game onto the monitor they were not on.
     So the surface the bracket takes has to differ between the two displays,
     and be the one the window is on.
  D  ...AND LEAVING PUTS THE WINDOW'S OWN TILE BACK.

BREAK IT ON PURPOSE: replace `OSAPI_FSX_SURF` with (0,0) plus `OSAPI_VIDEO`'s
size and leg C goes red naming both surfaces as 640x200; stop dd_relayout_ck
re-cutting on a size change and leg B goes red with the CGA's 8x4 tile still
in place on a 347-row window.

WHAT IT DOES NOT COVER, and this was checked rather than assumed: taking the
ADAPTER KIND out of dd_relayout_ck's bank leaves this row green, because the
window manager also changes the window's SIZE when it moves onto the Hercules
and the size comparison catches it first. The bank is for a move between two
displays that does not resize - which no machine in this tree has - so it
stands on its reasoning and not on this row.
