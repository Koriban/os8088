"""A GROW is not refused over a cache, and "Too big" is not said about memory.

    make small && python3 tests/regrowshed.py [machine]

SPEC.md 50.6.2.1 and 27.6.1, on the 128KB floor machine, through the one path
that put both defects on the glass at once: **Note Pad opening the manual.**

The field report was *"kern_small says Too big opening README.TXT"*, and the
arithmetic said it should work - Note Pad's small region is 13,475 bytes, the
manual is 14,722, and the machine has 52.5KB of heap. Two things were wrong
and each hid the other:

  `mem_regrow` had no SHED.  `mem_claim` has had shed-and-retry since
                             SPEC.md 50.6.2 and this routine never did, so a
                             grow was refused over three purgeable caches
                             holding 31,744 bytes - memory the kernel keeps
                             on the explicit understanding that it can give
                             it away.
  `np_load` said the wrong    The claim stayed at NP_KB0, the read compared
  thing about it.             14,722 against 1,024, and the file API answered
                              the only thing it can: FERR_BIG. So a MEMORY
                              refusal reached the user as a sentence about
                              the FILE, and the field went looking for a size
                              limit that was not the cause.

Four verdicts, and the third is the positive control WRITING-TESTS 1 asks
for - a Note Pad that never said "Too big" at all would pass the other three:

  loaded    README.TXT opens with the claim at NP_MAXKB and np_len at 14,427,
            the CRLF file FOLDED. This is the shed: measured on the machine,
            the claim starts at 1KB under a 6,144-byte raise cache with
            2,560 bytes of run free, and three sheds - cheapest first - are
            what open the 16KB it needs
  intact    ...and a REFUSED load leaves the note alone (SPEC.md 27.6), which
            is checked on the way through the next leg rather than costing
            one of its own
  toobig    PAINT.O88 is genuinely too big for this application, so it must
            still say so - with the claim AT the ceiling, which is the fact
            that makes the sentence true. Its size is DERIVED from the package
            on the disk and checked against NP_MAXKB, because a leg asserting
            a refusal goes vacuous the moment its subject fits: it is
            `image_unwrap`'s UNPACKED size and not the file's, since PKGZ
            packs the small floppies (SPEC.md 20.13.5) and dskw_rbody
            compares U
  nomem     ...and a SECOND Note Pad cannot fund a second 16KB document on a
            128KB machine, so its load is refused for real - and the toast
            must be "No memory" and never "Too big"

The toast is read out of `toast_buf` and not off the glass: it expires on a
tick count (SPEC.md 59), so a settle long enough to be sure a load finished
is long enough to lose it.

**How to make it go red** (WRITING-TESTS 1): take the `call mem_shed_one` out
of `mem_regrow.shed` and `loaded` fails with np_len 0; take np_load's
`cmp word [np_capkb], NP_MAXKB` out and `nomem` fails reading "Too big".
