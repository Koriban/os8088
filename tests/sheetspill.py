"""A long label runs on into the empty cells to its right (SPEC.md 81.54).

    make && python3 tests/sheetspill.py

Excel draws a label wider than its column across the EMPTY cells beside it,
and stops at the first one that holds anything. SHEET clipped every label to
its own cell, so an Excel 2.1 worksheet opened with its headings cut to seven
letters (81.52's screenshots: "1st Qua", "Ladies'").

This is about what is DRAWN, so it is read off the glass: SHEET opens a SYLK
the host wrote, and the host reads the 1bpp framebuffer, finds the grid by its
own lines - the rows from the longest evenly spaced run of horizontal lines,
the columns from the vertical ones that run unbroken through every row, which
no glyph can - and counts ink inside each cell, two pixels in from its lines.

  row 1  A1 is a 24-character label with B1:E1 empty - B1, C1 and D1 carry
         its text, E1 is past its end
  row 2  A2 is as long, and B2 holds a number - B2's left part stays empty
  row 3  A3 is "Hi" - B3 has nothing to show
  row 4  C4 is =REPT("ab",10), a TEXT RESULT of 20 characters - D4 and E4
         carry it, and E4 is only reached by the RESULT: the formula's own
         text is 13 characters and would stop in D4. B4, left of it, is empty
