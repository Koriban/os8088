"""DOES A LOAD THAT DOES NOT GROW THE WINDOW REACH THE GLASS? (SPEC.md 11.90.3.2)

    make && python3 tests/paintnogrow.py [--machine os8088_xt_vga]

§11.90.3.1 lets `wm_resize` answer `wm_damage` with the EMPTY rect when a
window did not grow and its origin did not move - nothing painted over what
survived, so the app owes its content nothing.  That is true of every resize
Paint made when it was written (the size boxes, the full-screen exit) and
FALSE of the two §54.10 added: `pt_onwake` and `pt_ondlg` resize the window
*after* a load has replaced the whole canvas.  The picture decoded perfectly,
`pt_blit_dmg` drew nothing over it, and the toast said `Opened` on a white
window.

**THE TWO ARMS ARE THE ROW**, and the second is what makes the first mean
anything.  `PT_CW_DEF` is 448, so a 448-wide picture leaves the CGA window
exactly the size it already was and is the failing case; a 466-wide one GROWS
it, takes `wm_resize`'s `.norz` arm, gets a real damage rect and drew
correctly all along.  A Paint that draws no picture at all fails both; the
defect this row is for fails ONLY the first, which a one-arm row would have
reported as "Paint is broken" or missed entirely.

The oracle is the SCREEN and not the canvas.  tests/paint1load.py already
compares the canvas against the file byte for byte and passed throughout -
the canvas was always right - so a second reading of it would be green with
the window still white.  The fixture is therefore a picture whose value is
in what it looks like: a solid black band across the middle rows and white
above and below it, so one screen row inside the band and one outside it
answer "drawn", "blank" and "stale" apart from each other.

Both arms are the same height, so on CGA (where `pt_chmax` clamps the fresh
canvas to the picture's own height) the ONLY difference between them is the
width, and on VGA both shrink the height - which is the same bug by the other
axis, and why `--machine` is a real second row rather than a duplicate.
