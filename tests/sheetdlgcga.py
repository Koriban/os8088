"""SHEET's tall dialogs keep their height on a CGA (SPEC.md 81.100).

    make && python3 tests/sheetdlgcga.py

A CGA's desktop band is 155 rows, and wm_fit cuts any window taller than it
(SPEC.md 11.93). SHEET's dialogs are FIXED layouts, and two are taller: the
radio column (171 rows) and Border (159). Their records were cut while the
package went on drawing every row - the radio kinds' OK and Cancel landed
through the bottom frame, outside the window's clicks, and a close left them
painted on the desktop (found photographing 1.8 on CGA). The list (147) and
Data Form (153) fit the band already; they are here as the controls, so a
change that shrank the band or grew them would show.

For each, on the cycle-accurate CGA machine, read out of the window table:
  - its height is the template's own (WF_KEEPH asked for it), and
  - it still ends on the display (y + h <= 200);
then close it and compare every row below SHEET's window with the photograph
taken before it opened: nothing may be left behind.
