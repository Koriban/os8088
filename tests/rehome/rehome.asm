;
; REHOME - the consumer that proves SPEC.md 20.12.10, a LOADER handing its
; identity to one of its own parts. A TEST package: `make rehome` builds it
; and no shipped floppy carries it, like tests/multiseg (SPEC.md 78.9).
;
; THIS FILE IS THE IMAGE, and its whole job is to stop existing:
;
;   1. op_load claims the carve and reads both parts;
;   2. op_seg says where each one landed;
;   3. the vector - a magic, the asset's segment and the carve's base - is
;      written into the HEAD OF THE PROGRAM'S BSS, which is inside part 0 and
;      which the kernel will not zero (SPEC.md 20.12.10.2);
;   4. OSAPI_PKG_REHOME names part 0 and the bytes available at it;
;   5. it returns CF=0 with BX=0 - NO WINDOW, which SPEC.md 20.12.10.6 makes a
;      refusal, its region being about to be freed.
;
; Then ld_start's step 8a frees this image's region, re-owns the carve to the
; instance slot, and runs step 8 again against part 0. The program's window is
; the one the user sees and this package's name is never on the screen.
;
; WHY THE IMAGE IS PADDED ODD is tests/multiseg's finding and applies here for
; the same reason: a part starts on a 512-byte boundary in the FILE, and
; op_claim's head slack (SPEC.md 20.12.2) is what bridges that to the cluster
; boundary OSAPI_FILE_READ_AT will start a read on - 1KB on a 360KB disk, 512
; bytes on a 1.44MB one. Unpadded the first part lands on a cluster on BOTH
; geometries, the slack is zero, and the arithmetic this row exists for never
; runs. IT MATTERS MORE HERE THAN THERE: a zero slack makes part 0's segment
; equal the carve's base, which is precisely the case SPEC.md 50.3.4 says the
; old fence answered correctly by accident.
