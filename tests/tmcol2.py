"""THE TASK MANAGER'S SECOND COLUMN CARRIES ROWS (SPEC.md 28.1.1, 28.1.2).

    make && python3 tests/tmcol2.py

CGA is the only shipped adapter that takes SPEC.md 28.1.1's two-column path -
155 usable pixels do not hold a useful list in one column, so the window
doubles in width and the process list wraps into a second column beside the
first. That column shipped EMPTY, from the day the mode landed, and this is
the row that would have said so.

**Why nothing caught it.** Every visible piece of the second column was
correct: the frame was twice as wide, the column-1 header was on the glass at
`TM_C2_HDR_Y`, and column 0 drew its rows. The header loop counts `[tm_cols]`
and never asks `tm_row_place` anything, so a screenshot showed a properly
composed two-column window with one of the columns blank - which reads as a
drawing fault in the rows rather than as a layout fault in the depth, and
reads like nothing at all in a diff.

The defect was one word (SPEC.md 28.1.2): the process list took column 0's
depth from `[tm_colrows]`, which is cut from the MEMORY view's `TMM_ROW_Y`.
The process list starts 30px lower, at `TM_ROW_Y`, so that depth named ~2.7
rows the frame has no height for. `tm_row_place` placed them in column 0 and
then refused them on `[tm_ylim]` - and that refusal is the one the
column-major order promises is MONOTONE, so `tm_rows` stopped there. It
stopped INSIDE column 0, and everything after it, the whole of column 1
included, was never reached.

So the assertion is about ROWS ON THE GLASS and deliberately not about the
window's shape:

  COL0   column 0 carries a row of text in every band `[tm_pcolrows]` deep.
  COL1   ...and column 1 in every band `[tm_col2rows]` deep - the leg that
         read [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].
  TAIL   ...and the band after the last one is BLANK, which is the negative
         control: a test that only counts ink upwards passes just as well on
         a routine that has stopped clipping at all, and that routine letters
         the list over the dock strip once a second (SPEC.md 28.1.1).
  LIST   the two columns together show the WHOLE list, TM_ROWS = 13 rows.
  LAUNCH the first row of column 1 is a real text row and not a free slot -
         which is the user-visible bug as it was reported: open a package
         once column 0 is full and it does not appear anywhere.

LAUNCH is the leg that needs the desktop set up, and the set-up IS the
reported repro: a Disk window, a package, a second Disk window, then the Task
Manager. That puts three built-in rows in column 0 (System and the two folder
windows) and pushes MINES and TaskMgr into column 1, so column 1's first band
is a package row rather than one of the `-` free slots that follow it.

**A free slot is not nothing**, and that is why LAUNCH measures ink rather
than presence: a `-` row is one scanline of about 36 pixels where a real row
is seven scanlines of about 300. Counting "is there ink" would pass on a
column of nothing but free slots, which is what the fix's first cut produced.

THE GEOMETRY IS READ OUT OF THE SOURCE, never restated here. Nine constants
decide where a row lands - seven of `apps/taskmgr/taskmgr.asm`'s and two of
the SDK's - and a test that hard-codes them is a test that goes quietly wrong
the day one of them moves.

`vram` and not `fbuf`: this is a CGA, so the framebuffer is flat in guest
memory and the 1bpp read is exact and cheap. And `guest_sleep` and not
`settle`, for tmground.py's reason - the performance view animates, so this
window never stills.
