"""Excel 2.1d's twenty-one number formats (SPEC.md 81.55).

    make && python3 tests/sheetnumfmt.py

SHEET had four - General, $#,##0, #,##0 and 0% - two bits of the format
byte. A date showed as its serial, a BIFF file's other formats read back as
General, and TEXT() knew nothing past '$ , 0 # . %'. The engine behind all of
them now is one (sh_fmtcode), drawing Excel's own codes; this gate holds the
grid, the Format Number list and the file to it. TEXT() - the same engine
through the evaluator - is tests/sheeteval.py's.

  1. The HOST writes a BIFF3 file: one XF per format, twenty cells naming
     them. SHEET opens it, and each cell's TEXT is read off the glass by the
     kernel's own glyphs (tests/glass.py) - what a person sees, exactly. A
     cell is seven characters wide, so a code whose result is wider fills
     with '#', as Excel's does, and a General number too wide takes fewer
     digits rather than showing part of itself.
  2. Format > Number on an EMPTY cell, "0.00" off the list, and then a value
     typed into it: the format was waiting (a cell with no record had nowhere
     to keep one, and the old dialog skipped it).
  3. Save As Normal: every cell names the XF of its own format again, and the
     file carries Excel's twenty-one FORMAT records in Excel's order.
