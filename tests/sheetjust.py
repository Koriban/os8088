"""Format > Justify re-wraps a paragraph down the left column (SPEC.md 81.81).

    make && python3 tests/sheetjust.py

Excel 2.1d's Reference Guide is specific about this command in ways "wrap a
long label" is not, and each of those specifics is a check here:

  1. **The wrap itself**, to the width of the WHOLE selection and not of the
     left column. A1:C4 is three standard 7-character columns, so the line is
     21 - and a build that used only the left column's 7 would produce a
     completely different, also plausible-looking, set of lines.
  2. **A blank cell is a PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR.** The Guide's own five-row
     example: a blank in the left column divides the range into sections that
     are each justified inside their own rows. This is the check with the
     teeth, because merging the whole column - the obvious implementation -
     produces the same LINES in a different PLACE, so a test that only asked
     "did it wrap" passes on it.
  3. **Unused rows are cleared.** A paragraph that shrinks must not leave its
     own tail on the sheet underneath the new text.
  4. **A value in the left column refuses the WHOLE command**, rather than
     being skipped or stringified. The Guide: the cells "must either contain
     text or be blank".

Everything is driven through the real menus and read back from SHEET's own
SYLK save, so what is asserted is the stored document rather than the glass.
