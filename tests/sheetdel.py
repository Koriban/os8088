"""File > Delete, and the No that must not delete (SPEC.md 81.79).

    make && python3 tests/sheetdel.py

Excel's File menu carries Delete after Save As; §81.39.2 listed it missing.
The kernel's file dialog has only OPEN and SAVE modes, so the PICKER is an
Open and a flag tells `sh_ondlg` what was meant by it - which makes two
things worth gating rather than one.

  1. **No must not delete.** The flag is cleared before the alert goes up, so
     a dismissed or refused alert cannot leave the NEXT Open behaving like a
     Delete either. This is the check that fails on a build where the answer
     is ignored, and the Yes check below would still pass on that build.
  2. **Yes deletes the file that was PICKED** - and leaves the open document
     alone. `sh_ondlg` copies the chosen name into `sh_name`, which is the
     open document's own name, so a Delete had to be given a buffer of its
     own; without it, Save afterwards would have written over the very file
     the user had just chosen to delete.

The volume is read back off the guest rather than the glass, because "is the
file gone" is a question about the DISK.
