"""SHEET's thirteen financial functions, computed by SHEET and checked by the
host (SPEC.md 81.37).

    make && python3 tests/sheetfin.py

WHY IT EXISTS: the financial family is the second tenant of CHART.OVL
(SPEC.md 82.16.10), and that move was not allowed to happen until something
could say it changed nothing - the rule 82.16.9 learned when the file-format
move failed twice and only the round-trip gate named why. This is that gate
for this family: written and passed against the RESIDENT code first, then
held against the moved one.

WHAT IT DRIVES is sheetfmt.py's route. The host authors a SYLK file of
formulas, SHEET opens it by association and saves it as SYLK, and the host
reads the values back off the floppy. Every formula is authored with a
DELIBERATELY WRONG cached value (-999). A SYLK cell carries both the
expression and the last answer, so a reader that trusted the answer instead
of recalculating would hand the host's own number back and pass - which is
the vacuous shape this tree has met more than once. -999 is not the answer to
anything here, so a pass means SHEET computed every one.

THE EXPECTATIONS ARE THE HOST'S OWN ARITHMETIC, from the definitions and not
from SHEET: the closed forms directly, RATE and IRR by bisection. Their
figures agree with the hand-verified tables in SPEC.md 81.37.2-81.37.8, which
were checked against Python the same way.

THE NESTING CASES are the ones the move is actually about. A financial
function's arguments are parsed by the RESIDENT evaluator, so
`=PMT(0.01,60,PV(...))` and `=SUM(PMT(...),1)` leave the module, re-enter the
evaluator, and - for the first - come back into the module while it is still
on the stack. The first must refuse with #VALUE! (sh_fnbusy: the argument
store is not banked per nesting level); the second must answer and leave the
parse where SUM expects it.
