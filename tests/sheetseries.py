"""Data > Series fills a range from its first cell (SPEC.md 81.72).

    make && python3 tests/sheetseries.py

Two dialogs in sequence - the TYPE as a radio column, then the STEP as a text
field - and a direction derived from the selection's own shape. What has to be
proved is that all three of those meet: the radio picks the arithmetic, the
typed step reaches it as a REAL number rather than an integer, and the fill
runs the way the selection is shaped.

Five columns, each seeded with its own start value in row 1 and then filled
down through row 4. Every selection here is FOUR ROWS TALL and at most two
columns wide, so every one of them fills down the columns - which is the
whole of the derived direction, and the first version of this file got it
wrong the other way: a selection of all five columns is WIDER than it is
tall, so Series filled along row 1 instead and overwrote every other
column's seed before its own case ran.

    A       B         C       D            E
    1       (label)   1       1990-01-31   1990-01-31

  1. LINEAR, step 2.5      A1..A4 -> 1, 3.5, 6, 8.5 - and 2.5 is the point:
     sh_pnum_at would have refused it, which is why the step is parsed with
     fp_atof instead. B is selected WITH it, and must be left alone: a column
     whose first cell is a LABEL is skipped whole rather than refusing the
     command, the case Excel leaves alone too
  2. GROWTH, step 3        C1..C4 -> 1, 3, 9, 27
  3. DATE: MONTH, step 1   D1..D4 -> 31 Jan, 28 Feb, 31 Mar, 30 Apr as
     serials - the month rolls and the day clamps, which is sh_ymd_to_ser's
     own behaviour and the reason that arm is two instructions
  4. DATE: YEAR, step 1    E1..E4 -> 1990..1993, same day
